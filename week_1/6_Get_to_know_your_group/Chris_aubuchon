answer to: What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? How will you combat that? What techniques will you try?
My biggest time management challenge is trying to figure out how much of each topic to memorize and how much to try to learn, or what retention level I should have on each topic.  I have been trying to combat this in the last couple of days by working through the examples more and focusing on the reading less.  This has allowed me to retain a higher amount because I am using the information, while developing better referencing abilities.  I have been trying to work through my roadblocks, head on, instead of trying to go around them.  I would love any feedback on new techniques.
